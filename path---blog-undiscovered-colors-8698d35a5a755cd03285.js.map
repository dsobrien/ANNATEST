My trip was already off to a bad start with the weather-induced flight delay, and the last thing I wanted was to lose my stuff. I walked up to the baggage claim and expressed my concern (in Spanish) and immediately realized that I did not understand a single word that was spoken back to me. The accent was so thick, and with words blended together seamlessly, it sounded like a cacaophony of unrecognizable Spanish words layered with a heavy Italian accent. There goes my confidence. I asked to speak to someone in English and they promptly filed my claim. I hung around the airport waiting for my 5-hour bus ride to Rosario (~200km away).

The bus driver let me know that we had arrived at my destination. I asked him to assist me in finding the exact door since it was my first time in the country and I'm a student with an assigned home. He happily got out and made sure that someone was home expecting me. We rang the doorbell and my host mother cheerily popped her head out the window with excitement. The bus driver wished me luck and went on his way. The door opened and there she was, a short, jolly, middle-age woman with a sweet, raspy voice. She embraced me at first sight and welcome me. We clicked right away. She showed me my room, gave me a tour of her lovely house, and served me some warm dinner (pastel del carne) with a refreshing glass of wine. We conversed about the whole fiasco I had just experienced. She could not speak English, so lucky for me, I was forced to speak in Spanish the whole time. She spoke slowly and with clarity, which helped me understand her much better and also helped me regain my previously lost confidence in my Spanish skills. I got extremely lucky with my host mom, she was everything I wanted. While I was bummed that I didn't have a perfect family to live with, I was gifted with the hospitality of the most affectionate and amiable host-mom I could asked for.
