I had always been the computer nerd in my family, so I thought why not? The bulky white box that dad brought home with a Windows 95 disc had me so engaged when I was a child, so I saw no harm in trying out something new. I learned programming by writing super basic programs and text-based games. One lecture specifically caught my attention: <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton\\\">Cellular Automata</a>. Seeing a bunch of random pixels interact with their on-screen neighbors consciously based on a few basic rules lit up a different part of my brain. Such a simple algorithm with such an entrancing visual. Maybe I can still draw and paint, but use code as my brush?</p>\\n<p>Well, no doubt. That’s when I stumbled down the rabbit hole of Computer Graphics. The revelation that I could still creatively express myself through code and make beautiful things turned my world upside down. It was the perfect definition of lazy man’s art. I define a simple set of constraints and let the computer pseudo-randomly run wild, yet somehow it can still produce something impressively artistic while I sit back and watch? Mind = blown.</p>\\n<p>\\n  <a\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-link\\\"\\n    href=\\\"/static/graphics-b9447f14439e7bf32a637fdd9a642d99-b2125.jpg\\\"\\n    style=\\\"display: block\\\"\\n    target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\n    rel=\\\"noopener\\\"\\n  >\\n  \\n  <span\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\\\"\\n    style=\\\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 690px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\\\"\\n  >\\n    <span\\n      class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\\\"\\n      style=\\\"padding-bottom: 56.30952380952381%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/2wBDABALDA4MChAODQ4SERATGCgaGBYWGDEjJR0oOjM9PDkzODdASFxOQERXRTc4UG1RV19iZ2hnPk1xeXBkeFxlZ2P/2wBDARESEhgVGC8aGi9jQjhCY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2P/wgARCAALABQDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFwABAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQACA//EABYBAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABBf/aAAwDAQACEAMQAAAB4IXY1Ef/xAAWEAADAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAASD/2gAIAQEAAQUCHP8A/8QAFBEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEP/aAAgBAwEBPwE//8QAFBEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEP/aAAgBAgEBPwE//8QAFBABAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIP/aAAgBAQAGPwJf/8QAGRABAAIDAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQARICGB/9oACAEBAAE/IYArYzmH/9oADAMBAAIAAwAAABD8P//EABURAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAR/9oACAEDAQE/EEf/xAAUEQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQ/9oACAECAQE/ED//xAAaEAACAwEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABEQAhQRBh/9oACAEBAAE/EDgMpToZWeQJW3WZ/9k='); background-size: cover; display: block;\\\"\\n    >\\n      <img\\n        class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-image\\\"\\n        style=\\\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\\\"\\n        alt=\\\"Prayash Thapa Effulgence Code Graphics Visual Art\\\"\\n        title=\\\"\\\"\\n        src=\\\"/static/graphics-b9447f14439e7bf32a637fdd9a642d99-ec749.jpg\\\"\\n        srcset=\\\"/static/graphics-b9447f14439e7bf32a637fdd9a642d99-d894e.jpg 173w,\\n/static/graphics-b9447f14439e7bf32a637fdd9a642d99-97c21.jpg 345w,\\n/static/graphics-b9447f14439e7bf32a637fdd9a642d99-ec749.jpg 690w,\\n/static/graphics-b9447f14439e7bf32a637fdd9a642d99-b2125.jpg 840w\\\"\\n        sizes=\\\"(max-width: 690px) 100vw, 690px\\\"\\n      />\\n    </span>\\n  </span>\\n  \\n  </a>\\n    \\n<em><a href=\\\"http://effulgence.io/Nucleactor\\\">Nucleactor</a>, an audio-visualizer I coded during a hackathon.</em></p>\\n<p>So there it was, all in front of me.

But, the validation felt assuring, and I promised myself to push farther and harder. But my dedicated slowly waned. I kept up as much crafts as possible, but I got too busy being a hooligan and playing video games to care enough about it.</p>\\n<p>Fast forward to 11 years old when I heard my uncle strum the chords of <em>Hotel California</em> by The Eagles in the other room. I walked over to see a massive dreadnought guitar in his embrace. There was something about those steel strings ringing together that caught my attention. Seeing my curious face, he generously offered to teach me a few chords. I learned the typical G -> D -> C progression while he sang <em>Knockin on Heaven’s Door</em>. That felt so good. I was hooked! I couldn’t put the guitar down after that.</p>\\n<p>\\n  <a\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-link\\\"\\n    href=\\\"/static/guitar-495c9702061941ac1f289c345cf6325b-0f993.jpg\\\"\\n    style=\\\"display: block\\\"\\n    target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\n    rel=\\\"noopener\\\"\\n  >\\n  \\n  <span\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\\\"\\n    style=\\\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 690px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\\\"\\n  >\\n    <span\\n      class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\\\"\\n      style=\\\"padding-bottom: 66.39427987742594%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\\\"\\n    >\\n      <img\\n        class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-image\\\"\\n        style=\\\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\\\"\\n        alt=\\\"Prayash Thapa Effulgence First Guitar\\\"\\n        title=\\\"\\\"\\n        src=\\\"/static/guitar-495c9702061941ac1f289c345cf6325b-ec749.jpg\\\"\\n        srcset=\\\"/static/guitar-495c9702061941ac1f289c345cf6325b-d894e.jpg 173w,\\n/static/guitar-495c9702061941ac1f289c345cf6325b-97c21.jpg 345w,\\n/static/guitar-495c9702061941ac1f289c345cf6325b-ec749.jpg 690w,\\n/static/guitar-495c9702061941ac1f289c345cf6325b-0f993.jpg 979w\\\"\\n        sizes=\\\"(max-width: 690px) 100vw, 690px\\\"\\n      />\\n    </span>\\n  </span>\\n  \\n  </a>\\n    \\n<em>My first guitar that I bought in 2013, and still play to this day.</em></p>\\n<p>I kept creating the occasional drawing or two in high school year, and art class was definitely the one I looked forward to the most.

This was a tribute to <a href=\\\"https://youtu.be/WrO9PTpuSSs?t=7m50s\\\">Nujabes</a>, a jazz-hop legend.</em></p>\\n<p>Sometime around my second year in college, I decided to enroll in an introductory programming course. I had always been the computer nerd in my family, so I thought why not? The bulky white box that dad brought home with a Windows 95 disc had me so engaged when I was a child, so I saw no harm in trying out something new. I learned programming by writing super basic programs and text-based games. One lecture specifically caught my attention: <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton\\\">Cellular Automata</a>. Seeing a bunch of random pixels interact with their on-screen neighbors consciously based on a few basic rules lit up a different part of my brain. Such a simple algorithm with such an entrancing visual. Maybe I can still draw and paint, but use code as my brush?</p>\\n<p>Well, no doubt. That’s when I stumbled down the rabbit hole of Computer Graphics. The revelation that I could still creatively express myself through code and make beautiful things turned my world upside down. It was the perfect definition of lazy man’s art. I define a simple set of constraints and let the computer pseudo-randomly run wild, yet somehow it can still produce something impressively artistic while I sit back and watch? Mind = blown.</p>\\n<p>\\n  <a\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-link\\\"\\n    href=\\\"/static/graphics-b9447f14439e7bf32a637fdd9a642d99-b2125.jpg\\\"\\n    style=\\\"display: block\\\"\\n    target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\n    rel=\\\"noopener\\\"\\n  >\\n  \\n  <span\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\\\"\\n    style=\\\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 690px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\\\"\\n  >\\n    <span\\n      class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\\\"\\n      style=\\\"padding-bottom: 56.30952380952381%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\\\"\\n    >\\n      <img\\n        class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-image\\\"\\n        style=\\\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\\\"\\n        alt=\\\"Prayash Thapa Effulgence Code Graphics Visual Art\\\"\\n        title=\\\"\\\"\\n        src=\\\"/static/graphics-b9447f14439e7bf32a637fdd9a642d99-ec749.jpg\\\"\\n        srcset=\\\"/static/graphics-b9447f14439e7bf32a637fdd9a642d99-d894e.jpg 173w,\\n/static/graphics-b9447f14439e7bf32a637fdd9a642d99-97c21.jpg 345w,\\n/static/graphics-b9447f14439e7bf32a637fdd9a642d99-ec749.jpg 690w,\\n/static/graphics-b9447f14439e7bf32a637fdd9a642d99-b2125.jpg 840w\\\"\\n        sizes=\\\"(max-width: 690px) 100vw, 690px\\\"\\n      />\\n    </span>\\n  </span>\\n  \\n  </a>\\n    \\n<em><a href=\\\"http://effulgence.io/Nucleactor\\\">Nucleactor</a>, an audio-visualizer I coded during a hackathon.</em></p>\\n<p>So there it was, all in front of me.
