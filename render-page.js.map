After spending 5 years at the University of Colorado Los Angles studying Computer Science and Digital Media, I’m happy to finally be done with school. What a trip that was! Academia was never my forte, and I always gravitated towards learning by doing instead of studying for exams or doing homework assignments. I guess I’ll forever be a student regardless of whether I’m in school or not. There are so many fascinating things to learn about that there isn’t nearly enough hours in the day to do it all. I definitely enjoy looking back to those all nighters working on programming assignments or putting off papers until the last day, either because I would rather procrastinate by playing music or going out with friends or doing other crazy things. I’m surprised I even survived all of that. Regardless, I’m grateful for the experience and all the personal and professional growth that came with it.</p>\\n<br>\\n<p>\\n  <a\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-link\\\"\\n    href=\\\"/static/old-room-377d56ea39bcf8241cb2cb7c5e506458-ea265.jpg\\\"\\n    style=\\\"display: block\\\"\\n    target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\n    rel=\\\"noopener\\\"\\n  >\\n  \\n  <span\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\\\"\\n    style=\\\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 690px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\\\"\\n  >\\n    <span\\n      class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\\\"\\n      style=\\\"padding-bottom: 56.2037037037037%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\\\"\\n    >\\n      <img\\n        class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-image\\\"\\n        style=\\\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\\\"\\n        alt=\\\"Creekside Apartments\\\"\\n        title=\\\"\\\"\\n        src=\\\"/static/old-room-377d56ea39bcf8241cb2cb7c5e506458-ec749.jpg\\\"\\n        srcset=\\\"/static/old-room-377d56ea39bcf8241cb2cb7c5e506458-d894e.jpg 173w,\\n/static/old-room-377d56ea39bcf8241cb2cb7c5e506458-97c21.jpg 345w,\\n/static/old-room-377d56ea39bcf8241cb2cb7c5e506458-ec749.jpg 690w,\\n/static/old-room-377d56ea39bcf8241cb2cb7c5e506458-f7d37.jpg 1035w,\\n/static/old-room-377d56ea39bcf8241cb2cb7c5e506458-ea265.jpg 1080w\\\"\\n        sizes=\\\"(max-width: 690px) 100vw, 690px\\\"\\n      />\\n    </span>\\n  </span>\\n  \\n  </a>\\n    \\n<em>My old bedroom-studio for most of my college career.

It took me precisely 43 job interviews, only 2 of which turned into legitimate offers. Now, I’m makin’ stuff at <a href=\\\"http://viget.com\\\">Viget</a>, a full-service interactive agency that specializes in custom web software and hardware. It’s been such a trip working with a really talented group of people doing a variety of things these past 6 months, and I’m excited to see where my journey with Viget leads to.

Tech wise, I’m heavily exploring JavaScript and React, two pieces of technology which have changed the way I look at software. It’s seriously such an exciting time to be a web programmer. There’s so many avenues to explore, but for me, it’s always been about making art and using the browser or the smartphone as my canvas. I’ve been exploring a lot of WebGL, GLSL, WebVR, and Mobile AR on my free time as well. I think the ideal day for me would be to spend half of it programming graphics and the other half playing music.

Scope it <a href=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwvlEhy5q5Y\\\">here</a>!</em></p>\\n<p>Now that I have no academic commitments, it’s been much easier to allocate time for music. The electro-acoustic stuff that <a href=\\\"http://soundcloud.com/effulgence\\\">I used to upload on SoundCloud</a> is still there, but I’m honestly more focused on honing my chops on the guitar before going back to the computer. I’d also like to focus on creating more videos instead of delivering just audio. I think there’s a lot to be explored in the audiovisual realm, especially once realtime software components are brought into the equation. I’ve got a few ideas brewing for the moment, but nothing concrete yet. There’s a million ways in how the software + music + visuals recipe could pan out, so more on that soon!

When all seemed to go wrong with the world, I’ve always been able retreat to music as my sanctuary.</p>\\n<br>\\n<p>\\n  <a\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-link\\\"\\n    href=\\\"/static/guitar-863b1a8d623d29e6d0c5a32bf2d29a4b-a7415.jpg\\\"\\n    style=\\\"display: block\\\"\\n    target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\n    rel=\\\"noopener\\\"\\n  >\\n  \\n  <span\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\\\"\\n    style=\\\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 690px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\\\"\\n  >\\n    <span\\n      class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\\\"\\n      style=\\\"padding-bottom: 56.25%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\\\"\\n    >\\n      <img\\n        class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-image\\\"\\n        style=\\\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\\\"\\n        alt=\\\"Guitar\\\"\\n        title=\\\"\\\"\\n        src=\\\"/static/guitar-863b1a8d623d29e6d0c5a32bf2d29a4b-ec749.jpg\\\"\\n        srcset=\\\"/static/guitar-863b1a8d623d29e6d0c5a32bf2d29a4b-d894e.jpg 173w,\\n/static/guitar-863b1a8d623d29e6d0c5a32bf2d29a4b-97c21.jpg 345w,\\n/static/guitar-863b1a8d623d29e6d0c5a32bf2d29a4b-ec749.jpg 690w,\\n/static/guitar-863b1a8d623d29e6d0c5a32bf2d29a4b-f7d37.jpg 1035w,\\n/static/guitar-863b1a8d623d29e6d0c5a32bf2d29a4b-31ec7.jpg 1380w,\\n/static/guitar-863b1a8d623d29e6d0c5a32bf2d29a4b-d9d57.jpg 2070w,\\n/static/guitar-863b1a8d623d29e6d0c5a32bf2d29a4b-a7415.jpg 3840w\\\"\\n        sizes=\\\"(max-width: 690px) 100vw, 690px\\\"\\n      />\\n    </span>\\n  </span>\\n  \\n  </a>\\n    </p>\\n<br>\\n<p>It all started with the guitar, and for me <a href=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHDN-TyN92U\\\">it’s always been about the guitar</a>. Acoustic guitar, specifically. In the music that I make, the guitar has always been the driving force regardless of all the other elements that surround it, whether that be synths, or strings, or vocals, or percussion. I remember when I was 11 back in Nepal, and I heard my uncle strumming the chords to Hotel California, so I asked him to teach me a few chords, and the rest is history. For a pretty significant chunk of my life, nothing else really existed for me in this world. I never pursued music formally so it’s all been a huge experiment. But my love for music has driven me to pursue it in a slightly obsessive way. From acoustically treating my room, to investing in a bunch of gear, and experimenting with all these different aspects of music like composing, producing and recording has been an absolute joy, and a form of therapy and medicine for me. Exploring this craft of bedroom musicianship in the midst of school, life, and work has been challenging undertaking of mine for the past several years. It’s provided me with this medium to explore my own imagination and bring these musical ideas in my head to life, and to try to add something to the musical collective – to figure out what it means to have my own creative fingerprint.</p>\\n<br>\\n<p>\\n  <a\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-link\\\"\\n    href=\\\"/static/soundcloud-ce2067e52991028e8d9ae0b7d8dabd6d-aca7e.png\\\"\\n    style=\\\"display: block\\\"\\n    target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\n    rel=\\\"noopener\\\"\\n  >\\n  \\n  <span\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\\\"\\n    style=\\\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 690px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\\\"\\n  >\\n    <span\\n      class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\\\"\\n      style=\\\"padding-bottom: 73.98325358851675%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\\\"\\n    >\\n      <img\\n        class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-image\\\"\\n        style=\\\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\\\"\\n        alt=\\\"Effulgence SoundCloud\\\"\\n        title=\\\"\\\"\\n        src=\\\"/static/soundcloud-ce2067e52991028e8d9ae0b7d8dabd6d-44d6a.png\\\"\\n        srcset=\\\"/static/soundcloud-ce2067e52991028e8d9ae0b7d8dabd6d-f4799.png 173w,\\n/static/soundcloud-ce2067e52991028e8d9ae0b7d8dabd6d-b3b1d.png 345w,\\n/static/soundcloud-ce2067e52991028e8d9ae0b7d8dabd6d-44d6a.png 690w,\\n/static/soundcloud-ce2067e52991028e8d9ae0b7d8dabd6d-bc0f7.png 1035w,\\n/static/soundcloud-ce2067e52991028e8d9ae0b7d8dabd6d-b50e5.png 1380w,\\n/static/soundcloud-ce2067e52991028e8d9ae0b7d8dabd6d-aca7e.png 1672w\\\"\\n        sizes=\\\"(max-width: 690px) 100vw, 690px\\\"\\n      />\\n    </span>\\n  </span>\\n  \\n  </a>\\n    </p>\\n<br>\\n<p>It all started with sharing my work on the Internet, which has been really inspiring. Starting with <a href=\\\"https://soundcloud.com/effulgence\\\">SoundCloud</a> way back when it was actually a vibrant community of like-minded musicians giving each other feedback on how we could improve our tunes, which seems to no longer be the case, to now uploading videos to <a href=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=effulgence+music&#x26;page=&#x26;utm_source=opensearch\\\">YouTube</a>.</p>\\n<p>I’ve learned a lot over the years, and the nice thing is that these lessons are applicable to many other aspects of my life, even software. And one could easily gather these lessons from any creative pursuit, whether that be dancing or painting, it’s just that music has been the primary medium of self-expression for me, so that’s what I’ll focus on.</p>\\n<br>\\n<h4>Zen mind, beginner’s mind.</h4>\\n<p>“In the beginner’s mind there are many possibilities, in the expert’s mind there are few.” - Shunryu Suzuki</p>\\n<p>There’s a great book called <a href=\\\"http://a.co/2jFZS80\\\">Zen Mind, Beginner’s Mind</a> that explores the idea of approaching a craft as if you were a beginner, because that sense of blissful ignorance and that childlike naiveté is really important to creativity. It elevates the act itself and it makes it so enjoyable. To let go of your own standards and expectations and transcend them and just engage in the art itself is key.</p>\\n<p>And the style of guitar that I play (fingerstyle guitar) is really an anomaly because I’m trying to utilize every part of the guitar – not just the strings. I’m slapping different parts of the body to create percussive sounds, and I’m also whacking the fretboard to create these slap harmonics, to playing over the neck so I can play a bassline with the left hand and do some percussive and lead with the right hand using a variety of techniques like tapping and hammer-ons. And something really weird, and kind of annoying sometimes about this style is the myriad of tunings that I end up using achieve different sounds. For those of you that are guitar nerds you can see that some of them are quite bizarre but they help me achieve what’s not possible with a standard tuned guitar. But it’s really about taking a fresh approach to the guitar. I really enjoy starting a song fresh in a different tuning and approaching it without any preliminary knowledge. I find that it helps me be more creative and more inspired because it forces me to break out of my own habits and patterns. And it leads to some really interesting problem solving and happy accidents that I find to be really beneficial to the creative process, and to keep the juices flowing.</p>\\n<br>\\n<h4>The Flow State is the High We All Chase</h4>\\n<p>The state of Flow is one of the best things about doing the work that we love. It’s pure magic. It’s the high we all chase. That moment when I am so deeply engrossed in the act of making music that the world around me vanishes. It almost feels like it’s not even <em>me</em> making music. It’s as if I’m a vehicle or a channel for something else to come through that’s really beyond me, and I simply need to open myself up to it. I look back at some of the music I’ve made and I can’t remember making the melodies or writing those chords. It feels like a total blur.</p>\\n<p>\\n  <a\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-link\\\"\\n    href=\\\"/static/flow-72199ed1ea7746391155ef30f16c6c65-3da88.jpg\\\"\\n    style=\\\"display: block\\\"\\n    target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\n    rel=\\\"noopener\\\"\\n  >\\n  \\n  <span\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\\\"\\n    style=\\\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 690px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\\\"\\n  >\\n    <span\\n      class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\\\"\\n      style=\\\"padding-bottom: 97.91666666666667%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\\\"\\n    >\\n      <img\\n        class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-image\\\"\\n        style=\\\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\\\"\\n        alt=\\\"Flow\\\"\\n        title=\\\"\\\"\\n        src=\\\"/static/flow-72199ed1ea7746391155ef30f16c6c65-ec749.jpg\\\"\\n        srcset=\\\"/static/flow-72199ed1ea7746391155ef30f16c6c65-d894e.jpg 173w,\\n/static/flow-72199ed1ea7746391155ef30f16c6c65-97c21.jpg 345w,\\n/static/flow-72199ed1ea7746391155ef30f16c6c65-ec749.jpg 690w,\\n/static/flow-72199ed1ea7746391155ef30f16c6c65-f7d37.jpg 1035w,\\n/static/flow-72199ed1ea7746391155ef30f16c6c65-3da88.jpg 1056w\\\"\\n        sizes=\\\"(max-width: 690px) 100vw, 690px\\\"\\n      />\\n    </span>\\n  </span>\\n  \\n  </a>\\n    </p>\\n<p>This chart really speaks to me, and I think to many of you as well. The balance between anxiety and boredom is so important to falling into the flow state where the level of challenge and the level of skill are just right to facilitate growth and also to make the work rewarding. I think it’s really important to have a place where we can fall into this state easily, as that’s where we do our best work.</p>\\n<br>\\n<h4>The Dance of Problem Solving &#x26; Creativity</h4>\\n<p>Making music is equal parts art and engineering. On one hand, we have the composition phase, where the sole purpose is to string together (pun intended) a bunch discrete ideas into a singular composition and to create a cohesive piece of music. For me, obviously, that’s going to be reaching for the guitar as that’s the most immediate extension of all my musical ideas.</p>\\n<br>\\n<p>\\n  <a\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-link\\\"\\n    href=\\\"/static/fiddle-dd8fd68fa2dbf8dd1d1c93c5abd22ae0-77baf.jpg\\\"\\n    style=\\\"display: block\\\"\\n    target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\n    rel=\\\"noopener\\\"\\n  >\\n  \\n  <span\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\\\"\\n    style=\\\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 690px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\\\"\\n  >\\n    <span\\n      class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\\\"\\n      style=\\\"padding-bottom: 66.66666666666666%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\\\"\\n    >\\n      <img\\n        class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-image\\\"\\n        style=\\\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\\\"\\n        alt=\\\"Acoustic Guitar\\\"\\n        title=\\\"\\\"\\n        src=\\\"/static/fiddle-dd8fd68fa2dbf8dd1d1c93c5abd22ae0-ec749.jpg\\\"\\n        srcset=\\\"/static/fiddle-dd8fd68fa2dbf8dd1d1c93c5abd22ae0-d894e.jpg 173w,\\n/static/fiddle-dd8fd68fa2dbf8dd1d1c93c5abd22ae0-97c21.jpg 345w,\\n/static/fiddle-dd8fd68fa2dbf8dd1d1c93c5abd22ae0-ec749.jpg 690w,\\n/static/fiddle-dd8fd68fa2dbf8dd1d1c93c5abd22ae0-f7d37.jpg 1035w,\\n/static/fiddle-dd8fd68fa2dbf8dd1d1c93c5abd22ae0-31ec7.jpg 1380w,\\n/static/fiddle-dd8fd68fa2dbf8dd1d1c93c5abd22ae0-77baf.jpg 1440w\\\"\\n        sizes=\\\"(max-width: 690px) 100vw, 690px\\\"\\n      />\\n    </span>\\n  </span>\\n  \\n  </a>\\n    </p>\\n<br>\\n<p>But then, there’s the science of it all. There’s so many technicalities that come to surface when I’m in the stage of fleshing out an arrangement. I need to make sure that other instruments aren’t clashing with each other and that each sound is occupying its own space in the frequency spectrum. I need to make sure the dynamic range of the song is appropriate and matches the energy levels. I need to tune the stereo image just right so that in the audio plane everything is sitting where it should. For example, higher pitched sounds should usually be distributed whereas lower pitched ones need to stay centered. And I need to make sure the sound is consistent across multiple sound systems and sounds as close as possible to what I’m hearing through my own speakers.</p>\\n<br>\\n<p>\\n  <a\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-link\\\"\\n    href=\\\"/static/mastering-760752474913f4fd3c8c0b86875fa11f-5ea1c.png\\\"\\n    style=\\\"display: block\\\"\\n    target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\n    rel=\\\"noopener\\\"\\n  >\\n  \\n  <span\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\\\"\\n    style=\\\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 690px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\\\"\\n  >\\n    <span\\n      class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\\\"\\n      style=\\\"padding-bottom: 59.62441314553991%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABQAAAAMCAIAAADtbgqsAAAACXBIWXMAAAsSAAALEgHS3X78AAACf0lEQVQozyVSWW/aQBj0c9U0NwQwNr69BhtsMLYDvrkxRwyEw4REJA2lSZVGbdW0aqQ+tvnV3aijeZhvNfNJs7tIy/d7QdButy3LhqzXG71ez3GdU62sKIoMKcuVStWyLNM04UmxWNR1o9lstjwbEQF3uZj++f1cLkgSz+ZY2gBkb1gbhn4AMQrDZXQ2n8ON3dc5mI+uIM6CVvc8QGiWe3j4/PflJV+QcYJE03iBxjpds9/WPL/Zn6yC6XlnPNZbZ+XGEDIYXG+328AtebaJMCxPkDRFMzTDZQgSzxAKjbmODdnp9IbRpubarW63sXzvTVbWaDUYrsMwbDqaXbMQTyvqaskoqxVDFwUgcIyZJ3otd9y/WI5vovA6HIXRYho0aoO623bNRX8B0bA12zGR2flkMZtG81kUzdbL6TKa396tN+uLu4/fHh9/fX18vv90PxnBjo3FaHB3e/P05en7j5/bzXp1eYkAUeZAjs/mOUHks6IoKzkpDyFDIeaNSlXVDdu2Pc+zHHf/OP52d//gOL53FHuzs4eQFJ0hKDwD25L/RSZDYjgBBcsBrVJ1Wg11NNOmkdYdHMbjMTSF0TQJwH4iiaBpDPrSr24CxzLJFJpC00ASE0kUXuTsw9V0cwVf2HGcqmUfxE52DmNxnExRHCsqCDShGHGSTCXQdBLFEmk8iZMgL8VPEnCd12mZdd91rJrvO55/hFHHFEiLxVSudEBlEZCVWCCwvKCohlZ1JEWlOZ5kuHe7e4lkiuUBD7K+Y9SaMO4xcpkzXNHta7pD5VUYFnNSgRdyHMjygkgxHEkxMMCwHOwMhJyQFS1Tr54arlU1LBf+TaNiasZpSdX+ARuaozW/pyJjAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC'); background-size: cover; display: block;\\\"\\n    >\\n      <img\\n        class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-image\\\"\\n        style=\\\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\\\"\\n        alt=\\\"Ableton Live 9\\\"\\n        title=\\\"\\\"\\n        src=\\\"/static/mastering-760752474913f4fd3c8c0b86875fa11f-44d6a.png\\\"\\n        srcset=\\\"/static/mastering-760752474913f4fd3c8c0b86875fa11f-f4799.png 173w,\\n/static/mastering-760752474913f4fd3c8c0b86875fa11f-b3b1d.png 345w,\\n/static/mastering-760752474913f4fd3c8c0b86875fa11f-44d6a.png 690w,\\n/static/mastering-760752474913f4fd3c8c0b86875fa11f-bc0f7.png 1035w,\\n/static/mastering-760752474913f4fd3c8c0b86875fa11f-b50e5.png 1380w,\\n/static/mastering-760752474913f4fd3c8c0b86875fa11f-0ed32.png 2070w,\\n/static/mastering-760752474913f4fd3c8c0b86875fa11f-5ea1c.png 3834w\\\"\\n        sizes=\\\"(max-width: 690px) 100vw, 690px\\\"\\n      />\\n    </span>\\n  </span>\\n  \\n  </a>\\n    </p>\\n<br>\\n<p>And all this stuff is fascinating. Recording, producing, mixing, mastering are all arts of their own and I’ve merely scratched the surface of each. But it’s so easy to get lost in the minute details during the process that losing the big picture is really easy. Writer’s block is one of the most common problems I run into, and I find it absolutely debilitating. I highly recommend the book The War of Art by Stephen Pressfield who talks about some of this. And one tactical way to battle writer’s block is to use Oblique Strategies by Brian Eno.</p>\\n<br>\\n<h4>Simplicity is the Ultimate Sophistication</h4>\\n<p>Sticking to the core idea is difficult when there are a million variables that I can play with at any given moment. And this reminds of a common saying by one of the greatest computer scientists of all time who says that premature optimization is the root of all evil.</p>\\n<p>I find that this is true in music where I just get stuck in a loop and an idea that was initially really inspiring can become stale very quickly if I get bogged down by the details of it too early during the writing process. Especially with such advanced music technology, it’s so easy to switch gears all the time and lose focus from the task at hand. So I usually just write the song as a solo guitar piece before moving it into the computer, and that seems to help a lot.</p>\\n<br>\\n<h4>Everything is a Remix</h4>\\n<p>All original ideas are <a href=\\\"https://vimeo.com/139094998\\\">variations of pre-existing ones</a>. I recycle musical ideas all the time. Any act of music-making at this point is a re-hash of something that’s already been done. <a href=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAcjV60RnRw\\\">Will we ever run out of new music?</a> No, not for a very long time.</p>\\n<p>There’s no need to reinvent the wheel every time. We all stand on the shoulders of giants. In the same way that programmers reach for that library or framework that already solves our problem, I never hesitate to reuse a chord progression, motif or a scale that I’ve heard or used before.</p>\\n<p>“Nothing is original. Steal from anywhere that resonates with inspiration or fuels your imagination. Devour old films, new films, music, books, paintings, photographs, poems, dreams, random conversations, architecture, bridges, street signs, trees, clouds, bodies of water, light and shadows. Select only things to steal from that speak directly to your soul. If you do this, your work (and theft) will be authentic. Authenticity is invaluable; originality is nonexistent. And don’t bother concealing your thievery. celebrate it if you feel like it. In any case, always remember what Jean-Luc Godard said: “It’s not where you take things from – it’s where you take them to.” – Jim Jarmusch</p>\\n<p>I really love the ending of this quote and to me it’s about creating an output that is an amalgamation of all the things that inspire and influence me as an artist and taking all of that and putting my own spin on it to achieve that degree of authenticity. It’s the creative fingerprint that I mentioned earlier.</p>\\n<h4>“Art is never finished, only abandoned.” - Leonardo da Vinci</h4>\",\"timeToRead\":8,\"frontmatter\":{\"date\":\"February 16, 2018\",\"title\":\"5 Things Music Taught Me\"}}},\"pathContext\":{\"slug\":\"/blog/5-things-music-taught-me\"}}\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./.cache/json/blog-5-things-music-taught-me.json\n// module id = 324\n// module chunks = 0","module.exports = {\"data\":{\"markdownRemark\":{\"html\":\"<ul>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://github.com/jorendorff/talks/blob/master/blame/blame.md#dont-blame-the-decaf-what-really-causes-software-failures-and-successes\\\">Don’t blame the decaf: What really causes software failures (and successes)</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"\\\"></a></li>\\n</ul>\",\"timeToRead\":1,\"frontmatter\":{\"date\":\"February 22, 2017\",\"title\":\"What Music Taught Me About Software Development\"}}},\"pathContext\":{\"slug\":\"/blog/software-development\"}}\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./.cache/json/blog-software-development.json\n// module id = 325\n// module chunks = 0","module.exports = {\"data\":{\"markdownRemark\":{\"html\":\"\",\"timeToRead\":1,\"frontmatter\":{\"date\":\"December 10, 2017\",\"title\":\"Gatsby.js + WebGL: A Match Made in Heaven\"}}},\"pathContext\":{\"slug\":\"/blog/gatsby-webgl\"}}\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./.cache/json/blog-gatsby-webgl.json\n// module id = 326\n// module chunks = 0","module.exports = {\"data\":{\"markdownRemark\":{\"html\":\"<p>Creative coding the practice of writing software for the sake of art.

At that time, I was living in <a href=\\\"https://goo.gl/maps/dRHoHcJc5WJ2\\\">Kathmandu, Nepal</a> (where I was born). My father bought me a water color set and some paint brushes for my birthday. I was hooked. Painting brought so much color to my life, literally. I looked forward to getting home from school every day so I could go crazy on the back pages of my school notebook. The nuances of the paint brush taught me a lot. It forced me to loosen my hands up and to avoid being stiff, and in many ways that taught me a lot about life. At some point, I got a set of color pencils and started outlining my paintings with them. That’s when drawing started to take precedence over painting. It was a nice break from all the splatter. I started being precise and bold with each stroke. It was the perfectly opposite thing for me to learn.

Seeing my curious face, he generously offered to teach me a few chords. I learned the typical G -> D -> C progression while he sang <em>Knockin on Heaven’s Door</em>. That felt so good. I was hooked!

This was a tribute to <a href=\\\"https://youtu.be/WrO9PTpuSSs?t=7m50s\\\">Nujabes</a>, a jazz-hop legend.</em></p>\\n<p>Sometime around my second year in college, I decided to enroll in an introductory programming course. I had always been the computer nerd in my family, so I thought why not? The bulky white box that dad brought home with a Windows 95 disc had me so engaged when I was a child, so I saw no harm in trying out something new. I learned programming by writing super basic programs and text-based games. One lecture specifically caught my attention: <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton\\\">Cellular Automata</a>. Seeing a bunch of random pixels interact with their on-screen neighbors consciously based on a few basic rules lit up a different part of my brain. Such a simple algorithm with such an entrancing visual. Maybe I can still draw and paint, but use code as my brush?</p>\\n<p>Well, no doubt. That’s when I stumbled down the rabbit hole of Computer Graphics. The revelation that I could still creatively express myself through code and make beautiful things turned my world upside down. It was the perfect definition of lazy man’s art. I define a simple set of constraints and let the computer pseudo-randomly run wild, yet somehow it can still produce something impressively artistic while I sit back and watch? Mind = blown.</p>\\n<br>\\n<p>\\n  <a\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-link\\\"\\n    href=\\\"/static/graphics-b9447f14439e7bf32a637fdd9a642d99-b2125.jpg\\\"\\n    style=\\\"display: block\\\"\\n    target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\n    rel=\\\"noopener\\\"\\n  >\\n  \\n  <span\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\\\"\\n    style=\\\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 690px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\\\"\\n  >\\n    <span\\n      class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\\\"\\n      style=\\\"padding-bottom: 56.30952380952381%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\\\"\\n    >\\n      <img\\n        class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-image\\\"\\n        style=\\\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\\\"\\n        alt=\\\"Prayash Thapa Effulgence Code Graphics Visual Art\\\"\\n        title=\\\"\\\"\\n        src=\\\"/static/graphics-b9447f14439e7bf32a637fdd9a642d99-ec749.jpg\\\"\\n        srcset=\\\"/static/graphics-b9447f14439e7bf32a637fdd9a642d99-d894e.jpg 173w,\\n/static/graphics-b9447f14439e7bf32a637fdd9a642d99-97c21.jpg 345w,\\n/static/graphics-b9447f14439e7bf32a637fdd9a642d99-ec749.jpg 690w,\\n/static/graphics-b9447f14439e7bf32a637fdd9a642d99-b2125.jpg 840w\\\"\\n        sizes=\\\"(max-width: 690px) 100vw, 690px\\\"\\n      />\\n    </span>\\n  </span>\\n  \\n  </a>\\n    \\n<em><a href=\\\"http://effulgence.io/Nucleactor\\\">Nucleactor</a>, an audio-visualizer I coded during a hackathon.</em></p>\\n<p>So there it was, all in front of me.

Every single night we sat down together for dinner and engaged in lively conversations spanning a variety of topics ranging from love, family, dreams, tragedy, politics, history, consciousness and spirituality amongst other things. It also helped that she knew practically no English, so I was forced to speak Spanish the entire time. She became my professora-at-home, helping me convert rudimentary Spanish sentences to more elegant ones. We developed an incredibly strong bond, and to this day, I still keep in touch with her.

The view was absolutely unreal and seeing the 3 bordering cities from the sky made the diversity of these places very obvious.</em></p>\\n<p>\\n  <a\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-link\\\"\\n    href=\\\"/static/boludos-8af2c2d4dce2b322f06b0652f703109b-791ec.jpg\\\"\\n    style=\\\"display: block\\\"\\n    target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\n    rel=\\\"noopener\\\"\\n  >\\n  \\n  <span\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\\\"\\n    style=\\\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 690px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\\\"\\n  >\\n    <span\\n      class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\\\"\\n      style=\\\"padding-bottom: 56.22188905547226%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\\\"\\n    >\\n      <img\\n        class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-image\\\"\\n        style=\\\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\\\"\\n        alt=\\\"Argentine Homies\\\"\\n        title=\\\"\\\"\\n        src=\\\"/static/boludos-8af2c2d4dce2b322f06b0652f703109b-ec749.jpg\\\"\\n        srcset=\\\"/static/boludos-8af2c2d4dce2b322f06b0652f703109b-d894e.jpg 173w,\\n/static/boludos-8af2c2d4dce2b322f06b0652f703109b-97c21.jpg 345w,\\n/static/boludos-8af2c2d4dce2b322f06b0652f703109b-ec749.jpg 690w,\\n/static/boludos-8af2c2d4dce2b322f06b0652f703109b-f7d37.jpg 1035w,\\n/static/boludos-8af2c2d4dce2b322f06b0652f703109b-791ec.jpg 1334w\\\"\\n        sizes=\\\"(max-width: 690px) 100vw, 690px\\\"\\n      />\\n    </span>\\n  </span>\\n  \\n  </a>\\n    \\n<em>We made some wonderful friends at the clubs in Rosario.

I think for me, the program was an excellent way of preparing myself for something bigger. I seriously had not had enough of this place. Argentina is a massive country and we hadn’t even scratched the surface. I itched to explore more.

Without further ado, I booked a flight right away. It was time to cross a few items off my bucket list.

I had arrived very late at night during a hostile snowstorm so it was basically 0% visible.

I could stare at this thing all day long. And I did.</em></p>\\n<p>Exploring all these new places by myself taught me countless things. One of the biggest things was learning to enjoy solitude. We’re so accustomed to constantly being surrounded by people that we forget what it’s like to enjoy our own company. I think developing that sense of peace with yourself and enjoying solitude is so important to living a happy life. Sure, I felt lonely as hell at times, but it was the perfect time for a lot of self reflection and re-evaluation. More importantly, being in a perpetual state of feeling nervous and outside of my comfort zone really helped me grow as a person. I never had a bubble to retreat to.</p>\\n<p>Perhaps the most important lesson I learned from this trip was to always be looking for undiscovered colors in my own life. Experiencing a totally foreign culture made me appreciate my own culture tenfold. It made me appreciate my own upbringing, my daily routine, my friends, family and loved ones. Towards the end, I actually missed the monotony of my own life. The things that once seemed mundane and ordinary all of a sudden seemed extraordinary when I distanced myself from it. After being exposed to vastly new and fresh experiences, I felt re-energized.</p>\\n<p>Traveling can have such profound effects on one’s sense of self-confidence and satisfaction with the world. In the end, we’re all humans and borders are artificial, man made constructs. We all operate under the same laws of human nature and intrinsically, the human connection is always there waiting to be felt regardless of skin color, religion, or nationalistic pride. I can’t count the times when other people went out of their way to help a stranger like me, especially when traveling alone. It restored my faith in humanity and reinforced my belief that people are inherently good-hearted and want to help other fellow humans.</p>\\n<p>This was my first time venturing outside of the US (aside from Nepal), and it surely won’t be my last. I couldn’t help but feel a lingering sensation of emptiness inside me when I woke up the morning after I landed back in the US. It really felt like I left a part of myself in Argentina that I’ll never get back. From all the wonderful people I met to the new experiences I had, I’m super grateful to have had the opportunity to do so. And making that solo trip happen in Patagonia witnessing its out-of-this-world beauty was the most liberating thing I could’ve done for myself. I’m already looking forward to returning to this beautiful, multi-faceted country.</p>\\n<p>Chau Argentina, siempre tendrás un pedazo de mi corazón. 🇦🇷</p>\",\"timeToRead\":7,\"frontmatter\":{\"date\":\"November 28, 2016\",\"title\":\"Undiscovered Colors\"}}},\"pathContext\":{\"slug\":\"/blog/undiscovered-colors\"}}\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./.cache/json/blog-undiscovered-colors.json\n// module id = 329\n// module chunks = 0","module.exports = {\"data\":{\"markdownRemark\":{\"html\":\"<p>When I started building this website, I started to think about what it would mean for it to be different.

The styling would crap itself on mobile. Gave it a nice harsh white background (cringe). I hardcoded all the markup and CSS. None of the images were optimized. It was a bunch of <code>&#x3C;div></code> elements floating next to each other in the middle of nowhere which brought about some interesting layout challenges in CSS. The site loaded extremely slow because of all the external assets I was pulling. I also had the wonderfully brilliant idea of embedding a bunch of soundcloud players and rendering them in an <code>&#x3C;iframe></code> when you clicked on a specific link. All of this made sense for me at the time but it also resulted in a very choppy experience. Frankly, it was not even a fully realized website.

It’s a single page with a bunch of jQuery spaghetti handling clicks and hiding/showing things on cue. Regardless, I got more experience making other sites (and apps). v2 harnesses the power of inline SVGs, meaning my whole graphic is embedded into my page as a bunch of numbers that the browser knows how to draw. Working with SVG allowed me to be meticulous about the design. It gave me full control of the sizing, curvature of lines, relative placement of the blocks, all with added benefit of not having to write any custom CSS to achieve the same layout. And if I wanted to change something I could simply pop back into Illustrator, make my changes, and copy-paste the new numbers into my HTML. I embedded my navigation links wrapping the <code>&#x3C;path></code> tags of the SVG. And search engines would still crawl through it, because in the end, it’s all just markup. Brilliant, thank you W3C.</p>\\n<p>You might have also noticed that v2 has an animation running in the back. Shortly after v1 and v2, I started spending more time exploring the realm of <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_coding\\\">creative coding</a>. I started a project where I coded a graphic everyday for the year (I failed halfway through but that’s another story). But the 100+ pieces that I did do taught me a lot. It became clear to me that I needed to incorporate this into my website. And off I went trying to integrate a <code>&#x3C;canvas></code> element into my site because animations are cool. They add so much to the visual experience. I was an art-major.. of course I was going to add this to my site. Who am I kidding?</p>\\n<p>v2 gave me a much clearer direction as to where I wanted my site to go. I was happy that I had something unique, and it had a cool animation with some content, but the experience wasn’t satisfying enough to me. I hated using some hacky jQuery just to get the single page application feeling, and I didn’t want to remake the whole thing using some hot new JavaScript framework that come out this morning to accomplish that. And I certainly didn’t want my whole page to be rendered dynamically on load, even though Google does index pages that use JavaScript to render their UI. I also wanted to start a blog, so I could post more content. Also the page had no sense of history, meaning that you were stuck on one page and could not navigate using the back and forward buttons. Not a good user experience. There had to be another way.</p>\\n<p>I considered using Jekyll (a static site/blog generator), but I REALLY wanted the single page design to work. I did not want the page to refresh every time the user navigated to another page on the site. I wanted it to be a unified, cohesive experience from one part of the site to another, no jitters and no refreshes. The Web has come so far, why not utilize it to its fullest?</p>\\n<p>After a lot of research, I ran into an awesome new framework called <a href=\\\"https://www.gatsbyjs.org/\\\">gatsby.js</a>, a static site generator that transforms plain text into dynamic blogs and websites using React (an amazing library that lets you create functional UIs). It has no page reloads, supports global page transitions, and leverages server-side rendering so all the components are rendered into raw markup for production builds. You mean I can blog, create a static site, and embed all the interactivity I want without having to compromise the user experience? I’ll take it.</p>\\n<p>Finally, we arrive at v3:</p>\\n<p>\\n  <a\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-link\\\"\\n    href=\\\"/static/v3-c6e126fcc20068595b2f2a7e80943bf6-93e81.jpg\\\"\\n    style=\\\"display: block\\\"\\n    target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\n    rel=\\\"noopener\\\"\\n  >\\n  \\n  <span\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\\\"\\n    style=\\\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 690px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\\\"\\n  >\\n    <span\\n      class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\\\"\\n      style=\\\"padding-bottom: 52.47058823529412%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\\\"\\n    >\\n      <img\\n        class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-image\\\"\\n        style=\\\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\\\"\\n        alt=\\\"effulgence.io v3\\\"\\n        title=\\\"\\\"\\n        src=\\\"/static/v3-c6e126fcc20068595b2f2a7e80943bf6-ec749.jpg\\\"\\n        srcset=\\\"/static/v3-c6e126fcc20068595b2f2a7e80943bf6-d894e.jpg 173w,\\n/static/v3-c6e126fcc20068595b2f2a7e80943bf6-97c21.jpg 345w,\\n/static/v3-c6e126fcc20068595b2f2a7e80943bf6-ec749.jpg 690w,\\n/static/v3-c6e126fcc20068595b2f2a7e80943bf6-f7d37.jpg 1035w,\\n/static/v3-c6e126fcc20068595b2f2a7e80943bf6-93e81.jpg 1275w\\\"\\n        sizes=\\\"(max-width: 690px) 100vw, 690px\\\"\\n      />\\n    </span>\\n  </span>\\n  \\n  </a>\\n    \\n<em>Awwww yeee.

For example,\n// a zlib stream might take multiple plain-text writes(), and then\n// emit a single compressed chunk some time in the future.\n//\n// Here's how this works:\n//\n// The Transform stream has all the aspects of the readable and writable\n// stream classes.  When you write(chunk), that calls _write(chunk,cb)\n// internally, and returns false if there's a lot of pending writes\n// buffered up.  When you call read(), that calls _read(n) until\n// there's enough pending readable data buffered up.\n//\n// In a transform stream, the written data is placed in a buffer.  When\n// _read(n) is called, it transforms the queued up data, calling the\n// buffered _write cb's as it consumes chunks.  If consuming a single\n// written chunk would result in multiple output chunks, then the first\n// outputted bit calls the readcb, and subsequent chunks just go into\n// the read buffer, and will cause it to emit 'readable' if necessary.\n//\n// This way, back-pressure is actually determined by the reading side,\n// since _read has to be called to start processing a new chunk.  However,\n// a pathological inflate type of transform can cause excessive buffering\n// here.  For example, imagine a stream where every byte of input is\n// interpreted as an integer from 0-255, and then results in that many\n// bytes of output.  Writing the 4 bytes {ff,ff,ff,ff} would result in\n// 1kb of data being output.  In this case, you could write a very small\n// amount of input, and end up with a very large amount of output.  In\n// such a pathological inflating mechanism, there'd be no way to tell\n// the system to stop doing the transform.  A single 4MB write could\n// cause the system to run out of memory.\n//\n// However, even in such a pathological case, only a single written chunk\n// would be consumed, and then the rest would wait (un-transformed) until\n// the results of the previous transformed chunk were consumed.\n\n'use strict';\n\nmodule.exports = Transform;\n\nvar Duplex = require('./_stream_duplex');\n\n/*<replacement>*/\nvar util = require('core-util-is');\nutil.inherits = require('inherits');\n/*</replacement>*/\n\nutil.inherits(Transform, Duplex);\n\nfunction TransformState(stream) {\n  this.afterTransform = function (er, data) {\n    return afterTransform(stream, er, data);\n  };\n\n  this.needTransform = false;\n  this.transforming = false;\n  this.writecb = null;\n  this.writechunk = null;\n  this.writeencoding = null;\n}\n\nfunction afterTransform(stream, er, data) {\n  var ts = stream._transformState;\n  ts.transforming = false;\n\n  var cb = ts.writecb;\n\n  if (!cb) {\n    return stream.emit('error', new Error('write callback called multiple times'));\n  }\n\n  ts.writechunk = null;\n  ts.writecb = null;\n\n  if (data !== null && data !== undefined) stream.push(data);\n\n  cb(er);\n\n  var rs = stream._readableState;\n  rs.reading = false;\n  if (rs.needReadable || rs.length < rs.highWaterMark) {\n    stream._read(rs.highWaterMark);\n  }\n}\n\nfunction Transform(options) {\n  if (!(this instanceof Transform)) return new Transform(options);\n\n  Duplex.call(this, options);\n\n  this._transformState = new TransformState(this);\n\n  var stream = this;\n\n  // start out asking for a readable event once data is transformed.\n  this._readableState.needReadable = true;\n\n  // we have implemented the _read method, and done the other things\n  // that Readable wants before the first _read call, so unset the\n  // sync guard flag.\n  this._readableState.sync = false;\n\n  if (options) {\n    if (typeof options.transform === 'function') this._transform = options.transform;\n\n    if (typeof options.flush === 'function') this._flush = options.flush;\n  }\n\n  // When the writable side finishes, then flush out anything remaining.\n  this.once('prefinish', function () {\n    if (typeof this._flush === 'function') this._flush(function (er, data) {\n      done(stream, er, data);\n    });else done(stream);\n  });\n}\n\nTransform.prototype.push = function (chunk, encoding) {\n  this._transformState.needTransform = false;\n  return Duplex.prototype.push.call(this, chunk, encoding);\n};\n\n// This is the part where you do stuff!\n// override this function in implementation classes.\n// 'chunk' is an input chunk.\n//\n// Call `push(newChunk)` to pass along transformed output\n// to the readable side.
